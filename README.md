# map_bridge_backend_flask

Backend server for https://map.justgeektechs.com/.  Use this server when you need to download higher resolution satellite images with a zoom level greater then 14.  This is because you will be downloading and combining thousands of images which the browser cannot handle.

This app is a simple python web flask app bundled into an exe.  Download the release and unzip.  Place anywhere on your pc.  Double click the exe to start the server.  On the map app above go to settings and check the Backend server. Also put in your download path such as C:\mapapp\sat_images.
